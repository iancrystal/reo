      <h1>REO AGENTS CONNECT</h1>
<p>
This application is used by asset management companies to search for REO
agents to manage their REO properties.
</p>
<h2>General Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Asset management companies can search for a REO agent in an area using
google maps. The asset manager can view the detailed profile of an agent by
clicking on a markup on the map or clicking on an item in the list on the
left sidebar.

</li>
<li>The asset manager can create/update notes for certain REO agent.

</li>
<li>REO agents can also be searched using &quot;Advanced Search&quot; - using a
search form where one can enter any of the profile details to be used in
the search.

</li>
<li>REO agents can sign up by entering their profile, contact information, and
account password. There are already 1 million agents in the database
(loaded from a purchased database). When an agent signs up, their email is
searched in the database and if the email is found, the sign up form will
be pre-filled with the data from the database. REO agents can upload their
resume and photo.

</li>
<li>Asset management company accounts can only be created by the admin. However
asset management companies can edit their account after logging in.

</li>
<li>Only the admin can update the membership status of a REO agent.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Database Overview</h2>
<p>
The following are the database tables and their short description.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>agents</dt><dd>Contains the name, contact information, credentials, membership status and
password of REO agents. Also contains the filenames of the resume and
picture file stored in Amazon S3 storage.

</dd>
<dt>zipcodes</dt><dd>Contains the latitude and longitude of all 41,328 standard zipcodes. Also
contains city and state to be used in displaying the service area section
of the REO agent profile display.

</dd>
<dt>agents_zipcodes</dt><dd>The join table for agents and zipcodes. Contains the agent_id to zipcode_id
mapping for each service area an agent services (a REO agent can have many
service area zipcodes)

</dd>
<dt>addr_latlngs</dt><dd>Contains the latitude and longitude of the physical address of each agent.
During a map search, if a REO agent has a service area in the area being
searched, the physical address is used to mark the map instead of the
zipcode to avoid overlaps, but only if the physical address is inside the
search area. Else the zipcode is used to markup.

</dd>
<dt>asset_companies</dt><dd>Contains the account information for each asset company.

</dd>
<dt>asset_company_notes</dt><dd>Contains the notes. Each note record contains the agent_id of the agent the
note belongs to and the asset_company_id of the asset company that created
the note.

</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Authentication Scheme</h2>
<p>
This application uses a simple but powerful login/authentication tecnique.
All controllers go through the <a
href="../../classes/AuthorizeFilter.html">AuthorizeFilter</a>
(helpers/authorize_filter.rb). The filter class method looks at the
controller and action of the request and decides if the current user is
authorized or not.
